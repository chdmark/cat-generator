# Cat Generator

## Background

This cat generator is based on the MVC model using only raw Ruby. The generator is run on the terminal and accepts user input to generate a random cat. The user has the ability to select what action they want the cat to perform. The decision to use the MVC model was to keep everything cleaner and easier to read. In addition, it was more efficient to pass information.
